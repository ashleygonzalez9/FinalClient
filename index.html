				<h2 class="desk"> The Hamsa</h2>
				<p class="para">  The Hamsa Hand is a symbol where religions merge whether it comes to things they have in common or things they share.In all three Abrahamic faiths it is a sign of protection and blessing. The hamsa hand has two main styles. One style is shaped like a regular hand, and the other has two symmetrical thumbs. It is believed to give the owner success, happiness, health, harmony, and protection from The Evil Eye.The hamsa hand meaning has a variety of interpretations, depending on the culture. The word, “hamsa,” derives its name from the five fingers on the hand. In Judaism it is interpreted to be the Hand of Miriam (the sister of the prophet Moses), and symbolic of the owner’s five senses in an effort to praise God. In Islam it symbolizes the Hand of Fatima (daughter of the prophet Muhammed). Finally, in Christianity the symbol represents the Hand of Mary (the mother of Jesus Christ).</p>

				<h2 class="desk"> What it means to Dani...</h2>
				<p class="para"> The hamsa is a symbol Dani learned about in grad school at CSUF while studying religious history and Arabic. She focused on studies of interconnectivity and shared meaning of common symbols, saints, rituals, and pilgrimage locations in the Levant. The hamsa reminds Dani of all she learned in grad school, the dear friends she made there, and of the thesis she wanted to write that would have required her to go to Syria just as the civil war broke out there. To Dani the hamsa symbolizes more than a good luck charm. It reminds her to be thankful, to bless others, and to pay attention to what is happening in the world and help however she can.</p>
